Encrypt a message for any number of recipients and with any number of \
passwords, optionally signing the message in the process.

The converse operation is `sq decrypt`.

`sq encrypt` respects the reference time set by the top-level \
`--time` argument.  It uses the reference time when selecting \
encryption keys, and it sets the signature's creation time to the \
reference time.
