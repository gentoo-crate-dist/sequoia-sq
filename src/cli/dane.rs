"Looks up certificates using DANE

By default, any returned certificates are stored in the local
certificate store.  This can be overridden by using \"--output\"
option.

When a certificate is downloaded using DANE, and imported into the
local certificate store, any User IDs with the email address that was
looked up are certificated with a local DANE-specific key.  That proxy
certificate is in turn certified as a minimally trusted CA (trust
amount: 1 of 120) by the local trust root.  How much the DANE proxy CA
is trusted can be tuned using \"sq link add\" or \"sq link retract\"
in the usual way.
