"Retrieves a certificate from a keyserver.

By default, any returned certificates are stored in the local
certificate store.  This can be overridden by using \"--output\"
option.

When a certificate is downloaded from a verifying keyserver
(currently, this is limited to a list of known servers:
keys.openpgp.org, keys.mailvelope.com, and mail-api.proton.me), and
imported into the local certificate store, the User IDs are also
certificated with a local server-specific key.  That proxy certificate
is in turn certified as a minimally trusted CA (trust amount: 1 of
120) by the local trust root.  How much a proxy key server CA is
trusted can be tuned using \"sq link add\" or \"sq link retract\" in
the usual way.
