"Generate a new key

Generating a key is the prerequisite to receiving encrypted messages
and creating signatures.  There are a few parameters to this process,
but we provide reasonable defaults for most users.

When generating a key, we also generate a revocation certificate.
This can be used in case the key is superseded, lost, or compromised.
It is a good idea to keep a copy of this in a safe place.

After generating a key, use `sq toolbox extract-cert` to get the
certificate corresponding to the key.  The key must be kept secure,
while the certificate should be handed out to correspondents, e.g. by
uploading it to a key server.

By default a key expires after {} years.
Using the `--expiry=` argument specific validity periods may be defined.
It allows for providing a point in time for validity to end or a validity
duration.

`sq key generate` respects the reference time set by the top-level
`--time` argument.  It sets the creation time of the key, any
subkeys, and the binding signatures to the reference time.

Note that this operation does not reliably remove User IDs from a
certificate that has already been disseminated! (OpenPGP software
typically appends new information it receives about a certificate
to its local copy of that certificate.  Systems that have obtained
a copy of your certificate with the User ID that you are trying to
strip will not drop that User ID from their copy.)

In most cases, you will want to use the 'sq key userid revoke' operation
instead.  That issues a revocation for a User ID, which can be used to mark
the User ID as invalidated.

However, this operation can be useful in very specific cases, in particular:
to remove a mistakenly added User ID before it has been uploaded to key
servers or otherwise shared.

Stripping a User ID may change how a certificate is interpreted.  This
is because information about the certificate like algorithm preferences,
the primary key's key flags, etc. is stored in the User ID's binding
signature.

sets the authentication flags, and means that the key may be used for
authentication (e.g., as an SSH key). These two flags may be combined.

`--can-encrypt=storage` sets the storage encryption flag, and means that the key
may be used for storage encryption. `--can-encrypt=transport` sets the transport
encryption flag, and means that the key may be used for transport encryption.
`--can-encrypt=universal` sets both the storage and the transport encryption
flag, and means that the key may be used for both storage and transport
encryption. Only one of the encryption flags may be used and it can not be
combined with the signing or authentication flag.

At least one flag must be chosen.

When using `--with-password`, `sq` prompts the user for a password, that is
used to encrypt the subkey.
The password for the subkey may be different from that of the primary key.

Furthermore the subkey may use one of several available cipher suites, that can
be selected using `--cipher-suite`.

By default a new subkey never expires. However, its validity period is limited
by that of the primary key it is added for.
Using the `--expiry` argument specific validity periods may be defined.
It allows for providing a point in time for validity to end or a validity
duration.
