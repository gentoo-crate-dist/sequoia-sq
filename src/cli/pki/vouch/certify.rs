"Certify a User ID for a Certificate

Using a certification a keyholder may vouch for the fact that another \
certificate legitimately belongs to a user id.  In the context of \
emails this means that the same entity controls the key and the email \
address.  These kind of certifications form the basis for the Web of \
Trust.

This command emits the certificate with the new certification.  The \
updated certificate has to be distributed, preferably by sending it to \
the certificate holder for attestation.  See also `sq key \
approvals`.

By default a certification expires after {} years. \
Using the `--expiration` argument specific validity periods may be defined. \
It allows for providing a point in time for validity to end or a validity \
duration.

`sq pki vouch certify` respects the reference time set by the top-level \
`--time` argument.  It sets the certification's creation time to the \
reference time.
