"Certify a User ID for a Certificate

Using a certification a keyholder may vouch for the fact that another
certificate legitimately belongs to a user id.  In the context of
emails this means that the same entity controls the key and the email
address.  These kind of certifications form the basis for the Web of
Trust.

This command emits the certificate with the new certification.  The
updated certificate has to be distributed, preferably by sending it to
the certificate holder for attestation.  See also `sq key
attest-certifications`.

By default a certification expires after {} years.
Using the `--expiration` argument specific validity periods may be defined.
It allows for providing a point in time for validity to end or a validity
duration.

`sq pki certify` respects the reference time set by the top-level
`--time` argument.  It sets the certification's creation time to the
reference time.
