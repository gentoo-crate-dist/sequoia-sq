//! User prompting.
//!
//! Some operations require a password or need to prompt the user to
//! do something like insert a smartcard.  The library can't prompt
//! the user directly, as the application is responsible for
//! interacting with the user.  Similarly, the application shouldn't
//! have to deal with too much OpenPGP logic; that's the library's
//! responsibility.
//!
//! There are several ways to separate these concerns.  The prompting
//! can be done upfront.  Unfortunately, figuring out what is needed
//! beforehand can be as complicated as the operation itself, which
//! defeats the convenience of the library.  The operation can be
//! aborted with a machine readable error.  The application can then
//! prompt the user and retry the operation.  This requires the
//! implementation to carefully unwind the state, which is brittle,
//! and the error handling is still complicated for the caller.  The
//! operation can invoke a callback, which is provided by the
//! application and does the actual prompting.  This is the most
//! convenient for both the caller and the implementation, but it
//! means that an operation can block.  This library opts for the last
//! approach.
//!
//! # Prompting Framework
//!
//! This module provides a prompting framework that allows the library
//! to describe a prompt and to drive the user interaction, while
//! delegating the actual display and input retrieval to the
//! application.
//!
//! To use the prompting framework, functions like
//! [`Sequoia::key_generate`](crate::key::generate) take an object
//! that implements [`Prompt`].  When the library needs to get some
//! input from the user, it calls either [`Prompt::prompt`] or
//! [`Prompt::multiprompt`].  The application displays a prompt to the
//! user, and returns what the user entered.  The library then
//! continues execution.
//!
//! The library passes two arguments to [`Prompt::prompt`] and
//! [`Prompt::multiprompt`]: a [`Context`] object (or objects in the
//! case of `Prompt::multiprompt`) and a [`Check`] object.  The
//! `Context` structure describes the prompt.  These include machine
//! readable fields like [`Reason`] and [`Action`] as well as getters
//! than return reasonable human-readable strings like a prompt
//! ([`Context::prompt`]) and a window title ([`Context::title`]).
//!
//! The [`Check`] object checks the input.  For instance, if unlocking
//! a key, then the `check` function returns whether the password is
//! correct using [`CheckError`].  If not, the prompt should display
//! an appropriate error message and prompt the user again.
//!
//! # Asynchronous Closing
//!
//! An application may want to close the prompt asynchronously, e.g.,
//! after a certain amount of time, or if automatically detects that
//! the user inserts the requested token.  This can be done using
//! [`Prompt::close`].
//!
//! # State
//!
//! A [`Prompt`] will only be used once.  If the library needs to
//! prompt the user again, it will create a second prompt from a
//! [`PromptFactory`] and use that.
//!
//! In general you should be very careful about what you store in a
//! `Prompt` as you don't know exactly what context it will be used
//! in.  For instance, when [generating a key](crate::key::generate),
//! you might reasonably think that the prompt will only be used for
//! prompting for new passwords for the key, but key generate also
//! certifies the new certificate with the local trust root.  If the
//! local trust root's secret key material is password protected, it
//! will also prompt for a password to unlock it.  To determine what a
//! prompt is used for you should examine the passed [`Context`].
